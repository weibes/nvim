This is my nvim config. Pretty simple


### Usage:
To use, pretty much just throw this into your nvim config folder.
- On *nix, this is in ~/.config/nvim
- On Windows, this is in ~/AppData/Local/nvim

### todos:
- figure out wtf is happening with not being able to add swift to tree-sitter (something to do with needing to install treesitter-cli I believe)
- Figure out how to use gitsigns better
- figure out telescipe better
- refactor configs to not have lua/after/ folder
